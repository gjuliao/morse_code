> Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, 
  called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.[3][4] Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Ruy <a name="Ruby"></a>

> Ruby is A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. 
It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
